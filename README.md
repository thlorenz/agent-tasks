## Agent Tasks

Collection of tasks I performed with an AI agent including a quick run down and prompts that
were used as well as plans that were produced by the agent.

This should serve as a reference for general tasks as well as a help to perform similar tasks
without starting from scratch.

Each task explains its purpose in a readme and then includes the directories/files produced
while the task was created and processed.
